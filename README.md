# 2048-AI
This is an implementation of the popular mobile game 2048 in a 3x3 setting that also involves an AI that chooses the move. It demonstrates the improvement between looking one move ahead and two moves ahead.

2048.py - play the game in the command line yourself
2048AI.py - runs the game using the expectimax agent and shows the average score of a 1-step expectimax vs. a 2-step expectimax
expectimax2048.py - the code for the expectmax agent
test_2048.py - some tests used while setting up the game to make sure the implementation worked correctly
twenty48.py - the code that runs the game
twenty48_david.py - other test code for running the game
